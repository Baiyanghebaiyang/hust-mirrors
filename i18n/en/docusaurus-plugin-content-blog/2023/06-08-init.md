After development and testing, the brand-new Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) open-source software mirror site is now undergoing testing!

In terms of technology selection, we have chosen Tunasync from Tsinghua University as the synchronization manager and used Facebook's Docusaurus static site generation framework for website web page construction.

We have deployed this on a Dell PowerEdge R740 server and have initial plans to synchronize Arch Linux, Debian, and Ubuntu for internal testing within the club.

The mirror site's source code has already been open-sourced, and currently, we are planning to develop a set of one-click source switching scripts using POSIX Shell. Once they are tested for stability, they will be deployed alongside the current site.
